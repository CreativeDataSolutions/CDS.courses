Any samples with high leverage and DmodX may need to be removed to improve the model fit of projection pursuits like PCA.\n\n\n\nCreate a loadings plot to view variable contributions to samples scores. Use the labels to specify variable names and text size. Variables with large loadings on the x-axis or y-axis have the largest contribution to defining sample scores in the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. For example the following plot suggests that as sample scores move left on the x-axis the contain larger amounts of 1,5-anhydroglucitol. Variable loadings can be colored base on variable meta data. For example, we can view which variables displayed significant differences for class based on the statistical test (shown in green).\n\n\n\nCreate a biplot which overlays samples scores and variable loadings.
